# CSI-2110 Data Structures and Algorithms
Instructor:   
Professor WonSook LEE  
>Description:
The concept of abstract data types. Simple methods of complexity analysis. Trees. The search problem: balanced trees, binary-trees, hashing. Sorting. Graphs and simple graph algorithms: traversal, minimum spanning tree. Strings and pattern matching

## Objectives:
Students will learn in a systematic way the most commonly used data structures with emphasis on their abstract properties.
Understand the typical algorithms that operate on each kind of data structure and learn how to analise their performance.
Be able to compare different data structures for solving the same problem, and choose the best.
